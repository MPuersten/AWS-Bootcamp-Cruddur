# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy
Very much a catchup week, quickly moved through content to get on track with completing in time.

## Performed Activities
- Configured CodeBuild for building the backend from a provided repo and folder
- Configured CodePipeline to pull, build, and deploy the backend when a branch is merged with the 'prod' branch
