# Week 6 â€” Deploying Containers
This week was busy - I've added notes from research on deploying containers in AWS.

## Activities Performed
- Provisioned an ECS cluster in AWS Console
- Created Task and Service definitions for deploying the Backend in ECS
- Created Task and Service definitions for deploying the Frontend in ECS
- Created an ECR repo and pushed a built image for the Flask (python) Backend
- Created an ECR repo and pushed a built image for the React (js) Frontend
- Deployed the Backend as a service to Fargate
- Deployed the Frontend as a service to Fargate
- Provisioned and configured and Application Load Balancer (ALB) for use with the FE and BE

## Notes:

### ECS vs EKS vs Fargate

#### ECS

- Uses Docker containers
- Tasks and services
- Native with AWS service
- Simple, integrated soutions

#### EKS

- Managed Kubernetes orchestration service
- Broader range of community-driven tools
- Allows migrations of existing Kubernetes workloads

#### Fargate

- Serverless compute for ECS / EKS
- Do not have to manage infrastructure
- Simpler resource allocation and scaling

### Security

Create IAM roles specifically for interacting between hosted services, and in / out of other AWS services like a load balancer, RDS, DynamoDB, etc.

### Limiting Spend

Limit spend when running an ECS cluster by updating the deployed services to '0' which will stop the service and limit spend.
