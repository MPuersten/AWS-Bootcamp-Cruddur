## DynamoDB Notes
DynamoDB is a NoSQL database (No strict structure to documents that are added, much greater flexibility for data models). 
It is provided directly by AWS and intended for use in cloud.
DynamoDB offers typical cloud features such as:
- Scalability 
- Availability (redudancy over mutliple regions)
- Security with granual access control
- Cost scaling with pay-as-you-go

Dynamo also offers low, predictable latency even at scale as an application grows.
Additionally Dynamo is serverless, which means there are no servers that manage it, and it can scale easily
